# Recipe Project
# I will use HTML file only and its elements & attributes to create basic website
# I will also use GitHub to save my repository 
# Publish this site in the web


# REFLECTION:
# The major thing I learned in this project is how to put my projects in GitHub Repository
# I learned some command such as git add. , git commit  and git push origin main.
