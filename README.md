# Project Name : Odin Recipe

 I used HTML file only and its elements & attributes to create basic website.
 I also used GitHub to save my repository. 
 Published this site in the web.


 # REFLECTION:
 The major thing I learned in this project is how to put my projects in GitHub Repository.
 I learned some command such as git add git . ,git status,git log , git commit  and git push origin. main.
