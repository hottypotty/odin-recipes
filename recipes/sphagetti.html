        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><strong><em>Million dollar spaghetti</em></strong> is the perfect combination of noodles,
        lean ground beef sauce, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream.
        It's unbelievably good!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong> An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight servings.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Youâ€™ll need a pound of lean ground beef. You can use a mix of ground beef and ground turkey, if you prefer. </li>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti sauce:</strong> Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your own marinara sauce at home.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add richness and flavor to the baked spaghetti.</li>
            <li><strong>Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream: </strong>A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is essential for this decadent, creamy spaghetti sauce. </li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti.</li>
        </ul>
